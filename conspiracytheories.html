    <p> It's well known among many people from all over the world that strange </br>
and sometimes unexplainable events happen all the time. Although science has been able to debunk </br>
most conspiracies and in turn crush the hearts of hundreds of theorists, there are still </br>
generous amounts of events recorded that science just can't explain. Here are 5 very confusing theories </br>
from all around the world. With these it's important to keep an open mind.

    <p> Mattress Firm has been under the radar of many people not because of the quality of their mattresses but because <br/>
    they have so many stores, sometimes just around a corner. A commenter on Reddit suggested that Mattress Firm could be a money <br/>
  laundering operation, and it kind of makes sense. They mentioned that mattresses are not that high in demand and consumers <br/>
usually purchase a mattress every 7-10 years, so why are there so many Mattress Firms? </p>
