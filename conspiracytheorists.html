  <p> Anyone can call themselves a conspiracy theorist. Theorists sometimes have a <br/>
  difficult time because other people insult and make assumptions about them. <br/>
  One of the greatest platforms used by theorists is social media, more specifically Youtube. <br/>
  A quick search will result in hundreds of different people wanting to give their opinion on a theory. <br/>
  Depending on the person and the event, a theory can be full of facts and some type pf proof.
