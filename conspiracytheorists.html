  <p> Anyone can call themselves a conspiracy theorist. Theorists sometimes have a <br/>
  difficult time because other people insult and make assumptions about them. <br/>
  One of the greatest platforms used by theorists is social media, more specifically Youtube. <br/>
  A quick search will result in hundreds of different people wanting to give their opinion on a theory. <br/>
  Depending on the person and the event, a theory can be full of facts and some type pf proof.

<h2> Kendall Rae: </h2>

<h2> funwrita: </h2>
<p> Funwrita is popular for posting and reposting spooky twitter threads on her own twitter as well as her instagram. Her real name is Rita Nejmi and she  <br/>
  currently has over 225 thousand followers on Instagram and over 18 thousand followers on Twitter. The threads that she posts on Instagram  <br/>
  don't always come from her own Twitter profile. It's mostly a mix of people who want to share their ideas and she provides them with a way to <br/>
  make sure the information get's out there. Some of the things she posts are pretty farfetched but she overall does a great job with keeping everyone in <br/>
  suspense until she posts the next part of a thread.
